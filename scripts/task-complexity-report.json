      "taskTitle": "Project Setup and Authentication Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Project Setup and Authentication Implementation task into 5 subtasks, focusing on separating the initial project setup, Supabase configuration, authentication UI components, authentication API routes, and protected route implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, TailwindCSS, Shadcn/UI) and requires implementing a complete authentication system with multiple providers. The complexity comes from integrating these technologies and implementing secure authentication flows."

      "taskTitle": "Database Schema Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Database Schema Implementation task into 4 subtasks, focusing on creating each major table (Calendars, Groups, Events, SharedLinks) with their relationships, indexes, and row-level security policies.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating multiple database tables with proper relationships, indexes, and security policies. While the SQL is provided, implementing and testing the complete schema with proper security requires careful attention to detail."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Core Calendar Component Implementation task into 5 subtasks, focusing on calendar library integration, view switching functionality, time zone support, responsive design, and styling/theming.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a robust calendar component is complex due to the need to handle different views, time zones, and responsive design. This is a core component that many other features will depend on, requiring careful architecture and implementation."

      "taskTitle": "Event CRUD Operations",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Event CRUD Operations task into 4 subtasks, focusing on API route implementation, database query functions, frontend form components, and integration with the calendar component.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a complete set of CRUD operations across both frontend and backend. It requires implementing API routes, database queries, form validation, and integration with the calendar component."

      "taskTitle": "Appointment Creation Modal Interface",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Appointment Creation Modal Interface task into 3 subtasks, focusing on modal component creation, form field implementation with validation, and integration with the event creation API.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a complex form with multiple input types (text, date/time, color picker, dropdown) and validation. It's moderately complex but more focused than some other tasks."

      "taskTitle": "Group Management Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Group Management Functionality task into 3 subtasks, focusing on group CRUD API implementation, group management UI components, and integration with the event creation/display system.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing CRUD operations for groups and integrating them with the event system. It's similar in complexity to the appointment creation task but involves both backend and frontend components."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Shareable Calendar Links Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Shareable Calendar Links Implementation task into 6 subtasks, focusing on secure token generation, shared link database operations, permission controls, password protection, expiry functionality, and public calendar view implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it involves security considerations, token generation, permission controls, and creating public-facing views that work without authentication. The password protection and expiry features add additional complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Overlapping Events Display Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Overlapping Events Display Implementation task into 4 subtasks, focusing on event overlap detection algorithm, visual rendering of overlapping events, color differentiation implementation, and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex algorithms for detecting and positioning overlapping events, as well as visual rendering challenges. The need for performance optimization with potentially many events adds to the complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "User Profile and Preferences Management",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the User Profile and Preferences Management task into 3 subtasks, focusing on user preference database operations, preference UI components, and application-wide preference application.",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward compared to others, involving standard form components and preference storage. The main complexity comes from ensuring preferences are consistently applied throughout the application."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Application Deployment and Infrastructure Setup task into 4 subtasks, focusing on Supabase production setup, Vercel configuration and deployment, environment variable management, and post-deployment monitoring/maintenance.",
      "reasoning": "Deployment involves multiple services (Vercel and Supabase) and requires careful configuration of environment variables, security settings, and CI/CD pipelines. The production environment setup adds complexity compared to local development."
